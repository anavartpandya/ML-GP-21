# ML-GP-21
This repository contains the files of the movie recommendation machine learning project done under the metis summer project competition.

The main aim of this project is to recommend movies to the user based on his/her searches.

This repository contains 4 google colab .ipynb notebook links and 1 google drive folder link.

Components:

1. Google drive folder (ml-25) link: This is the folder where all the necessary data for the project is present. Its link is present in the 'LINK FOR THE MAIN FOLDER.md' file of the repository.
2. Data preprocessing google colab notebook links: All the codes used for preprocessing the data are distributed inside 3 google colab notebooks. The links to this notebooks are present in the 'LINK FOR ALL THE PRE-PROCESSING COLAB NOTEBOOKS.md' file of the repository.
3. Main google colab notebook link to run the project: The code which the user needs to run in order to get movie suggestions is present in the 'METIS_ML_FINAL.ipynb' google colab notebook. Link to this notebook is present inside the 'LINK FOR THE MAIN FILE.md' file of the repository.

How to run the project:

The data that is collected after running the data preprocessing code has been alreafy loaded to the google drive folder (ml-25). So the user do not need to run the data preprocessing google colab notebooks again to run the project. They are added in the repository just for learning purpose. However, if the user wants to run these google colab notebooks, he/she will need to mount the google drive in each of the colab notebooks.

The user needs to run the 'METIS_ML_FINAL.ipynb' google colab notebook whose link is given in the 'LINK FOR THE MAIN FILE.md' file to run the project. To run the notebook, user needs to mount the google drive in the notebook and then run each cell once. Every time the user wants to search a movie, he/she needs to run the last cell of the notebook. 

NOTE: There is one precondition for using the notebooks. When you will open the google drive folder('ml-25') in your google drive account, it will be present in your 'Shared drives' folder by default. You need to create a shortcut of the folder in the 'My Drive' of your google drive, i.e., the location of your shortcut will be 'My Drive' section of your google drive. Do not place the folder('ml-25') in any sub folder of 'My Drive'. Place it directly in 'My Drive'.
